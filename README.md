# Rewash2594

I am building long-term capability in cybersecurity through structured thinking, technical depth, and documented systems reasoning.

This profile is not a collection of random projects.
It is a **deliberate body of work** focused on understanding how control, authority, and trust propagate in real-world systems.

I approach security as an offensive-minded engineer.
My focus is not on tools or alerts, but on understanding how authority, trust, and control propagate through systems.
I document my reasoning and build minimal artifacts to make implicit security assumptions explicit.

## How I Think About Security

Most security failures are not caused by a single vulnerability.

They emerge from:
- implicit trust relationships
- delegated authority
- automation paths
- poorly understood identity boundaries

I approach security from an **offensive-minded engineering perspective**:

- Think like an attacker
- Reason like a systems engineer
- Document decisions, not just outcomes

I am not interested in reactive alert handling or infinite operational noise.
I am interested in **why systems fail**, not just *that* they fail.

## What I Am Building

This GitHub profile represents a multi-year learning and construction process.

The work here is organized around three core pillars:

### 1. Mental Models (Offensive Security)

I document how experienced attackers reason:
- reconnaissance as decision reduction
- exploitation as constrained choice
- post-exploitation as control expansion

Repository:
- `offensive-security-mental-models`

---

### 2. Engineering Notes & Deep Dives

I analyze *why* common security patterns behave the way they do:
- identity vs host control
- privilege escalation mechanics
- detection as a graph problem

These are not tutorials.
They are **explanatory notes** meant to solidify understanding.

Repository:
- `engineering-notes-and-deep-dives`

---

### 3. Cognitive Security Tools

I build small, non-operational tools that make abstract security concepts explicit.

Example:
- modeling identity-based trust graphs
- revealing implicit authority chains
- reasoning about risk without touching live systems

Repository:
- `dz-security-tools`

These tools are intentionally **non-exploitative**.
They exist to improve thinking, not automate attacks.

---

## Learning → Capability → Services

I am intentionally avoiding the trap of “no experience without a job”.

Instead:
- I document learning as artifacts
- I turn understanding into reusable frameworks
- I gradually translate capability into real-world services

Over time, this work will support:
- consulting
- assessments
- research-driven security services

The shape of that offering will evolve as my expertise evolves.

---

## Long-Term Direction

This is a long game.

I am building:
- depth over speed
- understanding over tooling
- systems thinking over buzzwords

If you are reading this, you are not seeing a finished professional.
You are seeing a **trajectory**.

And that is intentional.

## How to Read This GitHub

This GitHub profile is designed to be read as a system, not as isolated projects.

If you want to understand how I think about security, start here:

1. **offensive-security-mental-models**  
   Mental frameworks for reasoning about reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation decisions.

2. **engineering-notes-and-deep-dives**  
   Explanations of *why* security mechanisms behave the way they do, from an engineering perspective.

3. **dz-security-tools**  
   Small cognitive tools that make trust, authority, and control relationships explicit.

Optional context:

- **offensive-security-case-studies**  
  Applied reasoning using realistic scenarios.

- **how-i-study-cybersecurity**  
  The learning system behind this work.

Each repository reinforces the same idea:  
security failures are best understood by modeling systems, not by chasing isolated vulnerabilities.
